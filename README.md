# FredC vs. JSON

A simple JSON parser.

## Features

- A C library (WIP) for converting JSON strings into a usable format and stringifying data stored in that format.
- A probably not very useful testing CLI that reads .json files, converts them into the fredc format, and then stringifies and prints them back to stdout.

## Note

FredC vs. JSON doesn't care if you have trailing commas in your objects.
